# Movie Recommender System

This project, named "Movie Recommender System," was initially created in October 2021. It serves as a basic movie recommender system using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and data visualization libraries.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the following steps:
1. Loading movie ratings data from a remote source.
2. Combining movie ratings with movie titles.
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of movie ratings.
4. Building a basic movie recommendation system.

## Usage

To run this code, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory, and run the Jupyter Notebook named "Movie recommender (2).ipynb" in your preferred environment :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie_Recommender_System.git
cd Movie_Recommender_System
jupyter notebook "Movie recommender (2).ipynb"
